            <h1>How It Works</h1>
            <p>Oftentimes there isn't a good answer. No matter how you try to 
            rationalize the outcome, it doesn't make sense. And instead of 
            an answer, you are simply left with a question. Why?</p>

            <p>There were about twenty people on the dam. Most of them were 
            simply walking and getting exercise. There were a few who 
            were fishing. There was a family who had laid down a blanket 
            and they were having a picnic. It was like this most days 
            and nothing seemed out of the ordinary. The problem was that 
            nobody noticed the water leaking through the dam wall.</p>
